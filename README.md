### File Structure

/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # All CSS styles
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # JavaScript functionality
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # This documentation
```

## Customization

### Adding New Categories
To add new categories, update both the HTML select elements and the CSS category styles:

1. In `index.html`, add options to both category selects:
```html
<option value="newcategory">New Category</option>
```

2. In `styles.css`, add styling for the new category:
```css
.todo-category.newcategory { 
    background: #color; 
    color: #textcolor; 
}
```

### Modifying Colors
The app uses CSS custom properties for easy theming. Main colors can be changed by modifying the CSS variables or the gradient backgrounds.

### Extending Functionality
The `TodoApp` class is designed to be easily extensible. You can add new methods for additional features like:
- Due dates
- Priority levels
